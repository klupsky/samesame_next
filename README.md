  ## Collaboration



Create `Issues` here in the repository or in `Clickup`. Make sure to always link your **Pull Requests** to the to-dos. This is important so we can keep track and review done tasks.


### [](https://github.com/samesamestudio/kingkylie-shopify#branches)Branches

`main`  the main branch should not be used for development. Merge functioning code to the  `main`  branch but don't use it for dev.

```
git pull origin main
```

this makes sure that you work with the latest files from the  `main`  branch. (Change the branch name to the data you need)

----------

Create a new branch for every new component/functionality to make working together easier:

```
git checkout -b header
```

----------

Once you have finished working on  `header`, stage your changes and push them to the  `header branch`.

```
git add .
```

stages all changes

----------

```
git commit -m "your commit message"
```

commits the changes

----------

```
git push origin header
```

pushes all commited changes to the selected branch on github repo.

----------

Go to the github repo and greate a new pull request. Add your changes and issues you worked on to keep track of development. Add @samesamestudio for a review if needed.

If the Pull Request fixes the issue, then merge it into  `main`  or  `staging`  (if available).

----------

```
git checkout main
```

Switches you back to the  `main`  branch. Make sure to  `git pull origin main`  the latest changes that you merged, before creating a new branch again.

## Configurations

  

**ESlint**

  

  

> ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.

  

  

Configs can be found in `.eslintrc.js` in the project root.

  

  

**Prettier**

Configs can be found in `.prettierrc` in the project root.

  

  

**Path Alias**

  

  

> Path aliasing or aliases are preconfigured names used to replace long **paths** in files and resolve to certain directories on a codebase.

This boilerplate includes various concepts of styled components. It's free to decide what to use and what can be omitted.

  

Concepts such as: `Theming`, `CSS Variables in styled components`, `base styles`, `utlities`.

  

You can choose with what to go and delete what you don't need.

  

## Sanity Connection

Currently this repository has a set up Sanity (www.sanity.io) connection. Simply change the credentials in the `.env` file and you are good to go. If there is no backend needed, simply delete the `lib` file and the `files` in the `hooks` folder + run a `npm uninstall` on all `sanity packages`.

  

### Query language: groq

The content is queried in with `groq`, which is similar to `graphql`.

* How to: https://www.sanity.io/docs/how-queries-work

You can preview the response object in the `vision` tab in the `sanity studio`. There is an example query set up in `/lib/queries`.
